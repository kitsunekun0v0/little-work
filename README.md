# Machine Learning and Computer Vision programming
Here is the collection of previous work and exercises I've done in ML and CV fields during my study. Codes are written in Matlab and Python mainly. 

## Machine Learning
* [Perceptron](https://github.com/kitsunekun0v0/little-work/blob/master/ml/averaged_perceptron_classifier.py) - Perceptron can be seen as a single layer neuron network. This is a averaged weight perceptron for multi-classes classification written in Python. 
* [KNN](https://github.com/kitsunekun0v0/little-work/blob/master/ml/kNearestNeighbour.py) - A fully vectorised KNN classifier using L2 distance, written in Python. 
* [Softmax Cross-entropy](https://github.com/kitsunekun0v0/little-work/blob/master/ml/softmax.py) - Python function for finding loss and gradient of weight.
* [Softmax + SGD](https://github.com/kitsunekun0v0/little-work/blob/master/ml/sgd_softmax.py) - Implementation of SGD. It can be a python function for training multinominal logistic regression. 
* [Competitive Learning](https://github.com/kitsunekun0v0/little-work/blob/master/ml/simple_competitive_learning.m) - Competitive Learning is an unsupervised technique to cluster data. This is a Matlab implementation of a simple Competitive Learning.

## Computer Vision
* [ViBe](https://github.com/kitsunekun0v0/little-work/blob/master/vibe.m) - ViBe is an background subtrauction algorithm for videos. Refer to the [original paper](https://orbi.uliege.be/bitstream/2268/145853/1/Barnich2011ViBe.pdf) for more algorithm details. Codes written in Matlab.
